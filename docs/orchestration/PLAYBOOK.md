# Orchestration Playbook

> How `/orchestrate` runs. Obey `GUARDRAILS.md` (it wins on conflict). Source of truth for tasks is
> GitHub Issues + Projects (see below); this file is *how* to drive them. Reuse superpowers skills —
> do not reinvent.

## Command variants (dispatch on the argument)
- `/orchestrate` (no arg) — run the next tick.
- `/orchestrate status` — reconstruct + report only. **No execution, no writes.** Cheapest path.
- `/orchestrate approve <issue-number>` — **human-only**, never dispatched by an unattended tick (see
  GUARDRAILS "Approval is human-only"). When a human runs it: add the `approved` label to the given
  Issue, comment why, stop.
- `/orchestrate plan <issue-number>` — write the detailed plan for an Issue lacking one, via
  `superpowers:writing-plans`, then stop.
- `/orchestrate review-feedback` — run only step 8 below (feedback review), then stop. Also runs
  automatically at the end of any tick that logged a new `IMPROVEMENTS.md` entry.
- `/orchestrate stop` — set `STATE.md` → Stop-condition to "owner stop", commit, stop.

## Triage / INVEST gate
Before an Issue gets the `ready` label, it must pass a basic INVEST sanity check (Independent,
Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable — see the `feature` issue form). If it clearly
fails — too vague, too large for its stated effort, or not independently actionable — label it
`needs-clarification` instead of `ready` and stop; do not guess at intent.

Issue dependencies (`blocked-by`) are tracked via GitHub's native issue-dependency relationship,
not a label: set it through the Issue UI's "Blockers" panel, since there is no plain `gh issue`
subcommand for it (it's a GraphQL-only feature, reachable via `gh api graphql` if scripting it
later). Until that's automated, check an Issue's blocked status by reading its "Blocked by" panel
in the UI (or `gh api graphql` for the same data) before treating it as pickable in step 3 below.

## The tick (for `/orchestrate` with no arg)
1. **Read** `STATE.md`, `GUARDRAILS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`. Do not read source files yet.
2. **Reconcile reality:** `git status`, `gh pr list`, `gh issue list --label ready --state open`
   (sorted by the Project's manual rank). If reality diverged from `STATE.md`, correct `STATE.md` and
   continue.
3. **Pick the next action** = highest-ranked open Issue with the `ready` label and no unresolved
   `blocked-by` dependency. Then:
   - If it has no linked plan and is `effort:M` or larger → run the `/orchestrate plan` flow and stop.
   - If it is `effort:L`/`XL` and has no sub-Issues yet → split it per GUARDRAILS "Task sizing" and stop.
   - If it is **destructive** (per GUARDRAILS) and lacks the `approved` label → skip to the next ready
     Issue; if none, stop + notify.
   - Else → execute.
4. **Execute** via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Lean: dispatch one subagent per task; it
   reads only the Issue + its plan doc + the named files, never the whole tree. If context bloats
   mid-task per GUARDRAILS, checkpoint and hand off to a fresh subagent rather than pushing through.
   Tell the subagent to log friction as it goes: whenever it hits something worth noting (a wrong
   guardrail, a missing tool, an outdated doc), run
   `scripts/append_improvement.sh <local|template|unsure> "<note>"` inline rather than waiting.
5. **Gate:** run the task's verification commands; then `superpowers:requesting-code-review` (spec +
   code quality). At a deploy/milestone checkpoint, also run `/security-review`.
6. **PR:** open a PR referencing the Issue (`Closes #N`), then wait for CI; treat a red CI as a hard
   stop (do not merge). Never auto-merge to `main`.
7. **Write state back:** comment progress on the Issue; update `STATE.md`'s cursor/next-action only
   when on the orchestration home branch, never on a feature branch; append to `DECISIONS.md` if a
   decision was made.
8. **Feedback review:** if this tick appended any `IMPROVEMENTS.md` entries, run
   `scripts/improvements_since_cursor.sh`, classify each (`[local]` → PR in this repo; `[template]` →
   PR against the template repo per GUARDRAILS "Cross-repo writes"; `[unsure]` → `STATE.md` → Needs
   owner), then run `scripts/advance_improvements_cursor.sh` with the new total entry count. Skip this
   step entirely if nothing new was logged this tick.
9. **Close the tick:** print a one-screen summary (position, what you did, next action, anything
   needing the owner).

## Budget & checkpointing
Track work against the GUARDRAILS per-tick token budget. When near the limit, finish the current
step, write `STATE.md`, and stop with a clean resume note rather than starting a new task.

## Lean rules (always)
- Prefer `git`/`gh`/grep over reading files. Read a file only when about to change it.
- One subagent per task with an explicit file list. Summarize subagent results into STATE; do not
  pull their full transcripts into the controller context.
