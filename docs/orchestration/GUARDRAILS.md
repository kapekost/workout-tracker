# Orchestration Guardrails

> The autonomous runner (`/orchestrate`, scheduled or manual) MUST obey this file. When GUARDRAILS and
> any other doc conflict, GUARDRAILS wins. Linked decisions live in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Merge & branch rules
- **Never auto-merge to `main`.** Open PRs only; a human (or an owner-approved green-CI gate) merges.
- **Never force-push.** Never push directly to `main`.
- Feature branch → PR. No direct commits to `main`.

## Destructive operations (require an in-doc APPROVE flag)
A task is **destructive** if it does any of:
- Drops/renames DB tables or columns, or runs a migration with data loss.
- Deletes more than 10 tracked files in one task.
- Changes auth, session, secret, or token handling.
- Any other irreversible action (history rewrite, remote branch deletion).

**Flow:** a destructive task stays blocked until its Issue has the `approved` label (or, for
orchestrator-level tasks, `STATE.md` has its `- [x] APPROVE <task-id>` box checked). Unattended: flag
present → execute; flag absent → queue + report; **never guess**.

## Task sizing & context-budget decomposition
- Before dispatch, any task labeled `effort:L` or `effort:XL` MUST be split into linked sub-Issues at
  planning time, each sized `effort:M` or smaller, before any code changes start.
- If a dispatched subagent's context grows past the per-task budget below mid-task anyway, it MUST
  checkpoint progress to the Issue and `STATE.md`, then hand the remainder to a **fresh subagent**
  rather than continuing. Never push through a bloated context to "just finish."
- Default thresholds (tune per repo in `DECISIONS.md` if needed): a single task touching **more than
  40 files**, or costing **more than ~150k tokens**, must checkpoint and split/hand off.

## Cross-repo writes (template feedback)
- A `[template]`-tagged `IMPROVEMENTS.md` entry may only become a PR against the template repo using a
  named, explicit credential set up for that purpose — never implied by this repo's own `gh` auth.
- Template PRs are never auto-merged, exactly like destructive operations above.

## Deployment knowledge stays local
- Never commit a real deploy-target host, IP, hostname, SSH key path, or
  co-located service name to a tracked file. That's `AGENTS.local.md`
  territory (gitignored) — see `AGENTS.md`'s "Deployment knowledge stays
  local" section. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` describe the deploy *process*
  generically; `AGENTS.local.md` holds the literal, real-world specifics.

## Hard stops (always halt + notify — no flag overrides these)
- CI is red.
- A merge conflict needs human judgment.
- The per-tick token budget is exceeded.
- A single task would change more than 40 files.
- A force-push, or a direct push to `main`, is attempted (also forbidden by the branch rules above).
- Any secret/credential would be written to a tracked file.
- The requirement is ambiguous or contradicts an Issue's description / `DECISIONS.md`.
- A `copier update` produces a conflict — resolve manually, never auto-resolve.

On a hard stop: write the blocker under `STATE.md` → "Needs owner", notify, halt that thread cleanly.

## Budgets (lean contract)
- **Per-tick token budget:** ~150k tokens of work, then checkpoint cleanly even mid-task.
- Reload **docs, not the repo**. Fan execution to subagents; one task = one subagent with a scoped
  file list. `/orchestrate status` must do zero execution.
