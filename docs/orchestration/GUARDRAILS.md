# Orchestration Guardrails

> The autonomous runner (`/orchestrate`, scheduled or manual) MUST obey this file. When GUARDRAILS and
> any other doc conflict, GUARDRAILS wins. Linked decisions live in `DECISIONS.md`.

## The chain of authority

Two separate chains, so it's always legible whether the orchestrator can
accidentally escalate its own authority:

```
Human (raw feature request)
  -> `intake`-labeled Issue
  -> Triage / INVEST
  -> `ready`-labeled Issue (or `needs-clarification`, back to Human)
  -> Plan
  -> Agent executes
  -> Tests
  -> Code review
  -> PR -> Agent watches CI -> green -> Agent merges
```

```
Human approval
  -> `approved` label
  -> destructive operation becomes eligible
```

The second chain has exactly one entry point: a human. Nothing in this repo
— no tick, no schedule, no subagent, no `/orchestrate` invocation — may add
the `approved` label itself. See "Approval is human-only" below.

## Merge & branch rules
- **PRs merge once CI is green, with no further live approval per PR.** After opening the PR: run
  `gh pr checks <PR> --watch --fail-fast` to block until checks finish, then — only if that exits
  0 — `gh pr merge <PR> --squash --delete-branch`. This is a standing owner decision (see
  `DECISIONS.md`), not something re-asked each time.
- **Do not use `gh pr merge --auto` for this.** It only waits for checks that are configured as
  *required* via branch protection — with none configured (the common case for a fresh or private
  repo, where branch protection may not even be available on the free plan), `--auto` merges
  immediately, before CI has even started. Verified empirically 2026-08-26: a PR merged instantly
  while its test job was still `pending`. The watch-then-merge sequence above has no such gap and
  needs no branch-protection setup, on any repo.
- **A red CI is still a hard stop.** If `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast` exits non-zero, do not
  merge — fix it and push again, do not force through.
- **Never force-push.** Never push directly to `main`.
- Feature branch → PR. No direct commits to `main`.

## Destructive operations (require an in-doc APPROVE flag)
A task is **destructive** if it does any of:
- Drops/renames DB tables or columns, or runs a migration with data loss.
- Deletes more than 10 tracked files in one task.
- Changes auth, session, secret, or token handling.
- Any other irreversible action (history rewrite, remote branch deletion).

**Flow:** a destructive task stays blocked until its Issue has the `approved` label (or, for
orchestrator-level tasks, `STATE.md` has its `- [x] APPROVE <task-id>` box checked). Unattended: flag
present → execute; flag absent → queue + report; **never guess**.

### Approval is human-only
- `/orchestrate approve <issue>` exists only to be typed by a human, at a
  keyboard, deciding right then to unblock one specific task. It is not a
  command variant an orchestrator tick may dispatch to itself, on a
  schedule, or in response to anything an Issue says.
- No agent, at any point, adds the `approved` label or checks an `APPROVE`
  box in `STATE.md` — not "on the owner's behalf," not because a task looks
  safe, not because the owner said so in an earlier unrelated message. If
  approval looks like it should already exist and doesn't, that is a
  **hard stop**, not something to fix by adding the label.
- This is the one rule in this document that has no unattended-execution
  exception. There is no flag that overrides it.

## Intake before ready
- An Issue labeled `intake` has not been triaged. Never execute against it,
  never treat it as `ready`, never skip the Feature intake flow in
  `PLAYBOOK.md` to "just get started" because the ask seems obvious.
- Resolving an `intake` Issue means either relabeling it `ready` directly
  (small enough as-is) or splitting it into `ready` child Issues and
  closing it — never editing it in place into something execution picks up
  by coincidence.
- If shaping it requires an answer only the owner has, that's the same
  **hard stop** as a failed INVEST gate: relabel `needs-clarification`,
  stop, do not guess.

## Task sizing & context-budget decomposition
- Before dispatch, any task labeled `effort:L` or `effort:XL` MUST be split into linked sub-Issues at
  planning time, each sized `effort:M` or smaller, before any code changes start.
- If a dispatched subagent's context grows past the per-task budget below mid-task anyway, it MUST
  checkpoint progress to the Issue and `STATE.md`, then hand the remainder to a **fresh subagent**
  rather than continuing. Never push through a bloated context to "just finish."
- Default thresholds (tune per repo in `DECISIONS.md` if needed): a single task touching **more than
  40 files**, or costing **more than ~150k tokens**, must checkpoint and split/hand off.

## Cross-repo writes (template feedback)
- A `[template]`-tagged `IMPROVEMENTS.md` entry may only become a PR against the template repo using a
  named, explicit credential set up for that purpose — never implied by this repo's own `gh` auth.
- Template PRs merge on green CI the same way as any other PR — see "Merge & branch rules" above.
  The credential restriction above is the safeguard for this class of PR, not a separate merge gate.

## Deployment knowledge stays local
- Never commit a real deploy-target host, IP, hostname, SSH key path, or
  co-located service name to a tracked file. That's `AGENTS.local.md`
  territory (gitignored) — see `AGENTS.md`'s "Deployment knowledge stays
  local" section. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` describe the deploy *process*
  generically; `AGENTS.local.md` holds the literal, real-world specifics.

## Hard stops (always halt + notify — no flag overrides these)
- An agent is about to add the `approved` label, or check an `APPROVE` box, itself.
- An agent is about to execute against an `intake`-labeled Issue directly.
- A new owner comment on an in-progress or `intake`/`needs-clarification` Issue was found unanswered
  at the start of a tick (see PLAYBOOK step 2) — answer it before doing anything else that tick.
- CI is red.
- A merge conflict needs human judgment.
- The per-tick token budget is exceeded.
- A single task would change more than 40 files.
- A force-push, or a direct push to `main`, is attempted (also forbidden by the branch rules above).
- Any secret/credential would be written to a tracked file.
- The requirement is ambiguous or contradicts an Issue's description / `DECISIONS.md`.
- A `copier update` produces a conflict — resolve manually, never auto-resolve.

On a hard stop: write the blocker under `STATE.md` → "Needs owner", notify, halt that thread cleanly.

## Budgets (lean contract)
- **Per-tick token budget:** ~150k tokens of work, then checkpoint cleanly even mid-task.
- Reload **docs, not the repo**. Fan execution to subagents; one task = one subagent with a scoped
  file list. `/orchestrate status` must do zero execution.
