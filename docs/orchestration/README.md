# Workout Tracker — Orchestration: who does what

This is the entry point to `docs/orchestration/`. The other files here — `PLAYBOOK.md`,
`GUARDRAILS.md`, `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `IMPROVEMENTS.md` — are written for the agent
running `/orchestrate`. This one is for you.

## Roles, at a glance

| | You | The agent |
|---|---|---|
| Feature ideas | Originate, state outcome/constraints/priority | Never invents scope |
| Prioritization | Rank the Project board | Follows the board's rank, never reorders itself |
| Open questions | Answer via a comment on the Issue | Asks, waits, never guesses |
| Destructive approval | Sole holder of the `approved` label | Never self-approves |
| Execution | — | Plans, codes, tests, reviews, opens PRs |
| Housekeeping | — | Keeps STATE/DECISIONS/IMPROVEMENTS current, links docs, closes stale issues |
| Merge | Nothing — no one-time setup needed | Opens PR, watches CI itself, merges once green |
| Observability | Get pushed a notification when something needs you | Reports every tick into STATE.md + Issue comments |

## Feature Intake Cycle

Occasional, initiated by you — how a raw idea becomes shipped code:

```
You: raw idea -> Agent: ask clarifying questions (outcome, non-goals, constraints, priority)
  -> Agent: capture as `intake` Issue -> Agent: Triage/INVEST
  - small enough -> `ready`
  - needs your input -> `needs-clarification` -> You answer -> back to Triage
  - too big -> split into `ready` children
`ready` -> Agent: plan+execute+test+review -> PR -> Agent watches CI -> green?
  no -> back to execute (fix, push again)
  yes -> Agent merges, no further action needed
```

Full detail: `PLAYBOOK.md`'s "Feature intake" section.

## Steady-State Tick

Recurring, initiated by the agent — what `/orchestrate` does every time it runs:

```
Tick starts -> Reconcile git/gh/STATE.md -> new comments from you since last tick?
  yes -> answer them first
  -> pick next ready/intake Issue -> execute -> update STATE.md + comment on Issue
  -> needs you now? (new question / hard stop / nothing left unattended)
      yes -> PushNotification -> tick ends
      no -> tick ends
```
(Step 8, feedback review, is omitted above — it only runs when the tick logged a new
`IMPROVEMENTS.md` entry.)

Full detail: `PLAYBOOK.md`'s "The tick" section.

## What you'll actually do

- **Answer questions.** Check `intake`/`needs-clarification` Issues on the Project board and
  comment your answer directly on the Issue — that's the only interface the agent reads.
- **Prioritize.** Rank the Project board; the agent always picks the highest-ranked actionable
  Issue, never its own preference.
- **Approve destructive work.** Only you can add the `approved` label — see `GUARDRAILS.md`
  "Destructive operations."
- **Watch for a push notification.** You'll get one when a tick genuinely needs you — a new
  question, a hard stop, or the queue running dry. No notification most ticks is expected, not
  a sign something broke.
- **Merge is automatic.** The agent watches CI itself and merges once it's green — you don't
  need to click anything per PR, and there's no one-time setup required.
