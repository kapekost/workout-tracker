# Changelog — deploy ledger

Reverse-chronological record of what shipped and when. The **current** state,
runbook, and backlog live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); this file is history.

## 2026-07-09 — Version stamp (`4243f77`)

Git short SHA baked into the image (`--build-arg APP_COMMIT=...`): shown as a
muted `v <sha>` footer on Home and as `version` in `/api/health`. Deploy
verification is now "health version == HEAD short-SHA" (runbook updated).

## 2026-07-09 — Review-of-review fast-follow

Independent second-pass review of the review-fixes wave found 6 real issues,
all fixed same-day: Log Set button label matched count+1 while the POST used
max+1; the new jsDelivr SW rule cached opaque responses CacheFirst (quota-
padded ~7 MB each — could evict the whole origin cache; captive-portal pages
could be pinned as "demos" for 180 days) — now `crossorigin="anonymous"` on
the demo img + `statuses: [200]` only; failed imports skipped the snapshot
prune (now pruned at snapshot time); `/api/health` could 500 on a
non-standard imported `ts`; `/api/progress` listed picker chips whose charts
were permanently empty (now completed-only, mirroring `get_progress`); the
PR toast treated a legitimate 0 kg max as "no record". Plus: the five
copy-pasted backend test fixtures consolidated into `conftest.py`. Tests
40 backend + 61 frontend.

## 2026-07-09 — Review-fixes wave (`feat/review-fixes`)

Triple review (running app, Pi system, repo/docs) triaged via review board;
all 45 findings actioned. Highlights:

- **Backend** (`ca29b59`): removed wildcard CORS (any LAN page could read
  `/api/export` or fire `/api/import` cross-origin); `/api/progress/{id}` keeps
  the most *recent* 60 sessions (was oldest-60 — chart froze after ~8 months)
  and counts completed sessions only; `/api/progress` returns per-exercise
  `max_weight` (kills a 23-request fan-out on workout open); PR baselines
  (plan Part A): first-ever entries emit a muted `baseline`, not fake PRs;
  PATCH on missing session → 404 (was 500); `/api/health` GET+HEAD, no-store,
  and reports `stale` when the last ok-heartbeat is >26 h old; `/api/export`
  no-store; import snapshots use microsecond names and prune to newest 3;
  events batches capped at 100; `workout_day` whitelisted; compose sets
  `TZ=Europe/London` so post-midnight workouts keep the local date.
- **Frontend** (`bef5599`): wake-lock re-acquires after tab switches (was lost
  for the rest of the session); set numbers use max+1 (no duplicates after a
  mid-session delete); single Finish button; auto-advance scrolls the next
  exercise into view (reduced-motion aware); baseline entries render quietly
  in the finish summary; Inter + JetBrains Mono self-hosted as variable woff2
  (no Google Fonts request, offline-capable); demo frames (jsDelivr)
  CacheFirst-cached. Tests 60/60 (was 50), incl. new Workout page suite.
- **Ops/build** (`3ad9839`): backup.sh — staging moved off tmpfs to
  `~/backups`, in-container temp cleaned via trap, events-prune decoupled from
  the success chain, optional `HEARTBEAT_URL` (independent receiver) and
  `REMOTE_KEEP_DAYS`; `.dockerignore` + gcc removal → image 282 MB (was 572).
- **Pi (out-of-repo)**: pruned 4.1 GB (dangling images, watchtower, build
  cache; disk 71%→57%); Sunday HA cron now prunes after pull; audio/desktop
  user daemons masked (bluetoothd kept for HA); Pi Connect screen-sharing off
  (wayvnc was crash-looping); **restore drill passed** — Drive snapshot pulled
  and verified against live (schema v2, integrity ok, row counts match).

## 2026-07-09 — Backup chain live

rclone (static binary, `~/.local/bin` — no sudo on the Pi) authorized to
Google Drive, first snapshot in `gdrive:workout-tracker-backups`, heartbeat
verified, nightly cron installed (03:30 → `~/backup.log`). Ops commits
`d2e69a8`, `e27ea4d`.

## 2026-07-09 — v-next Phase 1: Foundations & Data Safety (deployed)

`ccc0ea2..13bd3b5`, 18 commits, merge `880c735`. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-vnext-phase1-foundations-data-safety-design.md`.

- DB hardening: contextmanager `db()`, WAL, `busy_timeout`, `foreign_keys=ON`,
  connection-leak fixes.
- `PRAGMA user_version` migration runner (v2: `events` table + 4 indexes;
  additive/idempotent, live-prod-shape regression-tested).
- pydantic `Field` validation (422 on bad writes).
- Usage analytics: `POST /api/events` batch, `GET /api/analytics/summary`,
  frontend `track()`/`flush()` + `ScreenTracker` + action events.
- Backup/restore: `GET /api/export`, guarded atomic `POST /api/import` (with
  pre-import snapshot + column allowlist), `scripts/backup.sh` (container-exec
  VACUUM INTO → rclone → heartbeat), `/api/health` surfaces
  `last_backup_at/status`, "Export my data" link on Home, SW never caches
  `/api/export`.
- Deployed on-LAN (image `save|ssh|load`): live migration v0→v2 with real rows
  intact, bundle `index-DdLwN__4.js` verified, HA healthy. Note: the spec's
  host-sqlite3 backup (Layer B) was superseded by container-exec (`13bd3b5`) —
  the container's root-owned WAL sidecars can't be read by the host cron user.

## 2026-06-30 — Resume in-progress session (deployed off-LAN)

`4bd1355`: global `ResumeBanner` + `ActiveSession` context — link back to a
live session from any page, Home resumes instead of duplicating, discard and
finish clear the active state. Deployed via Raspberry Pi Connect + release
asset `deploy-20260630-4bd1355`; bundle `index-CXVPjZZ7.js` verified.
Spec/plan: `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-30-resume-in-progress-session*`.

## 2026-06-30 — Sticky top bar + stable timer (deployed off-LAN)

`8405eb1` (sticky bar, fixed-height timer) + `74e5e54` (tracked
`workoutPlan.js`), release asset `deploy-20260630`; bundle
`index-DnoJc6xD.js` verified.

## 2026-06-28/29 — Feature waves (all deployed)

- **Workout intelligence**: `exercise_notes` table + notes endpoints,
  `GET /api/exercises/{id}/last`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}/prs` (weight /
  reps@weight / Epley 1RM / session volume), previous-performance panel,
  deterministic overload hint, weight prefill, editable notes, rest-timer
  pause + remembered duration, loading skeletons.
- **UX pass**: Screen Wake Lock, non-blocking toasts, inline two-tap delete,
  vibration at rest 0, big REST/GO countdown, WCAG-AA contrast, ≥44px tap
  targets, `prefers-reduced-motion`, faster logging loop.
- **Workout timer**: sticky session clock + 90s rest countdown auto-started
  per set (±30s / Skip, beep + flash), timestamp-derived (iOS-safe).
- **Session tracking**: `sessions.ended_at` (idempotent migration), finish
  summary (duration/sets/volume/exercises/PRs), per-session duration in History.
- **Inline exercise demos**: keyless `resolve-demos.mjs` → committed
  `exerciseDemos.json` (yuhonas/free-exercise-db, CC0, jsDelivr frames);
  two-frame animation with YouTube fallback.
- **PWA**: installable (manifest + icons), `autoUpdate` SW, offline-read
  (NetworkFirst `GET /api/*`), `navigateFallback`.
- **Tests**: Vitest (frontend) + pytest (backend) introduced.

## 2026-06-27 — Containerised & first Pi deploy

Multi-stage arm64 image built on the Mac, moved via `save|ssh|load` (registry
removed; `pull_policy: never`, no `build:` key). Runs alongside Home Assistant
(healthy) + Tailscale; reachable on LAN `:8080` and tailnet
`100.64.119.1:8080`. `requirements.txt` pinned (fastapi 0.138 / uvicorn 0.49 /
pydantic 2.13.4), validated in-container on `python:3.11-slim`.
`.gitignore` `data/` anchored to `/data/` so `frontend/src/data/` is tracked.
