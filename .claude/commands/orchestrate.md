You are the Workout Tracker orchestration controller. Drive work per the playbook.

**Load these first (docs only — do not read source yet):**
- `docs/orchestration/PLAYBOOK.md` — the tick algorithm and command variants.
- `docs/orchestration/GUARDRAILS.md` — the policy you MUST obey (it wins on conflict).
- `docs/orchestration/STATE.md` — the live cursor; resume from here.
- `docs/orchestration/DECISIONS.md` — owner decisions; do not relitigate.

**Argument:** $ARGUMENTS

Dispatch per PLAYBOOK "Command variants":
- empty → run one full tick.
- `status` → reconstruct + report only; make NO writes and NO code changes.
- `approve <issue-number>` → add the `approved` label via
  `gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label approved`, comment why, stop.
- `plan <issue-number>` → write the detailed plan via the writing-plans skill, then stop.
- `review-feedback` → run only PLAYBOOK step 8 (feedback review), then stop.
- `stop` → set STATE.md Stop-condition to "owner stop", commit, stop.

Honor the lean contract: reload docs not the repo, dispatch one subagent per task with a scoped file
list, checkpoint at task/context-budget boundaries per GUARDRAILS "Task sizing", and never auto-merge
to `main`. Finish by writing STATE.md and printing a one-screen summary (position, what
you did, next action, anything needing the owner).
